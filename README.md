# Locale-Fluent

Locale::Fluent is a perl implementation of
(Project Fluent)[https://projectfluent.org], which is a research project
by (Mozilla)[https://mozilla.org] aiming at more natural sounding translations.

Locale::Fluent is aimed at those who are looking for an alternative
at gettext for the translation of their projects.


The main advantage of Fluent translations over, for instance, gettext is
that different parts of a sentence can be costumized based on different
variables. As an example:

```
  shared-photos =
    {$userName} {$photoCount ->
        [one] added a new photo
       *[other] added {$photoCount} new photos
    } to {$userGender ->
        [male] his stream
        [female] her stream
       *[other] their stream
    }.

```

When processed with the following variables:

```
  { userName    => "Anne",
    useGender   => "female",
    photoCount  => 3,
  }

```

This results in the translation:

```
Anne added 3 new photos to her stream

```

To reach a similar result with gettext the translation would need to be done
in multiple small chunks, which would need to be translated one at a time.
